# Wildlife Image Segmentation with Deep Learning Models

## Introduction

This Bachelor's thesis focuses on the utilization of deep learning techniques in wildlife camera trap images for the task of animal image segmentation in scenarios with a high similarity to the object to be segmented

  

## Requirements

To set up our project, you'll need to install the libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation 

For a comprehensive understanding of the study, it's highly recommended to delve into the document [**Segmentación de imágenes de foto-trampeo mediante técnicas de aprendizaje profundo**](https://github.com/SergioPerea99/Image-Segmentation-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Sergio_Perea_2022_2023_compressed.pdf). 

Within this document, you'll find an in-depth investigation leading to the results of animal image segmentations.
